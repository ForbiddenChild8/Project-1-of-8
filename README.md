Tic Tac Toe AI Evaluation Engine

This project is a custom-built Tic Tac Toe engine that explores game-tree decision making using heuristic evaluation, positional weighting, and threat analysis. Instead of relying purely on brute-force minimax, the system simulates strategic reasoning by scoring board states based on offensive potential, defensive urgency, and move depth.

Key features:

Recursive move tree exploration with state mutation and undo logic
Heuristic scoring for threat creation and prevention
Depth-weighted evaluation to prioritize earlier strategic moves
Positional heatmap bias for stronger opening play
